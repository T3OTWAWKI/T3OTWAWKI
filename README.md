## Hi

I am a undergraduate Computer Science student at Purdue University, and below are some projects I am working on or have worked on:

 - Rocket League: I am a part of the Autonomous Robotics Club at Purdue, specifically, a part of the Rocket League project. We are working to make remote controlled cars play soccer autonomously on a scaled down field. We recently [restarted the project](https://github.com/purdue-arc/rocket_league_2) to rebuild it from the ground up.
 - Misinformation and Disinformation Browser Extension: As part of a class about Misinformation and Disinformation at Purdue, I helped create a proof of concept [browser extension](https://github.com/Purdue-Innovation-Capstone/browser) that can help flag websites that are known for misinformation and disinformation when users visit the website. There is also a [website](https://purdueinformationlab.netlify.app/) detailing more information.
 - [Adapting Entity Minecraft Mod](https://github.com/T3OTWAWKI/ai_entity): As a personal project, I am working on making a minecraft mod that adds a creature that will try and kill the player while learning from the player's actions. It is a work in progress and currently, the creature will follow the player if they are close to each other and can break blocks to get to the player.
